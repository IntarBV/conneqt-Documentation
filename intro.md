# Welcome to the conneqt documentation

conneqt is a program designed for creating managing and/or administrative systems, but can be used to other ends too. Within a tenant (a conneqt workspace), data is stored in assets. The form of, and what kind of data is stored in these assets is determined by the asset's asset type. This data can then be manipulated by flows, a visual coding based system. This means that no prior coding knowledge is necessary to start using conneqt.

For information on individual topics, please consult their respective pages.

If there is a part of the documentation is unclear, contains and error or is outdated, we kindly ask you to send an email to conneqtdocumentation@gmail.com so that we may update our documentation.
